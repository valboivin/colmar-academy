#COLMAR ACADEMY
....

  Colmar Academy is a website project completed for the "Freelance Website Development" program by Codecademy. 
  
....

  Its purpose was to design and create a responsive landing page.
  Basic wireframes for desktop and mobile view were provided. 
  However, it did not show how the site would react on a tablet.
  Fonts and colors were not specified neither.
  
....

  I've added multiple breakpoints to the CSS to make sure the site would look alright no matter what device the user would view the website on.
